# OSA Violation Tracker
A full-stack CRUD web application for a school project. It is essentially a tracking system that tracks students and their corresponding violations. It displays their student information, the details of the violation as well as adding and deleting students/violations.

A special project passed to my CFP (Computer Fundamentals and Programming) 01 elective class in order to attain a Grade of 100.

## Notes
- This is everything in the folder, and it does not contain a ``.gitignore`` file. This was meant to be a collaboration repo, a way to access the folder from two devices simultaneously without having the hassle of reinstalling packages. Although it could've worked another way, I just preferred to had it this way.
